Module 11 assignment
[Part 1]
Using Splinter (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) the site was opened and inspected to identify which elements to scrape. Beautiful soup was used to extract the text elements. This was then stored in a dictionary by looping through. 

[Part 2]
Splinter was again used to open the (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) temperature website and beautiful soup to extract all the rows from the table. The list was then looped through to get a list of rows and then converted to a dataframe with their corresponding column names. The data was then analyzed using pandas.
